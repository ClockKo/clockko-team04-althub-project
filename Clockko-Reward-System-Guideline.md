## Reward System Guidelines ##

# 1. Validate Reward Redemption Logic
** Ensure there is accurate and timely progress tracking on every user platform
** Ensure there is proper and clear redeemable reward documentation visible to users
** Ensure every reward redemption system checks user eligibility (e.g., required points or completed challenges).
** Enforce one-time use by tracking redemptions in a dedicated table
** Reject redemptions if user is not eligible for a reward or has already claimed the same reward.

# 2. Prevent Duplicate or Fraudulent Redemptions
** Implement different rewards for different levels or kinds of task or challenge
** Implement database-level uniqueness (user + reward combination cannot repeat).
** Use transactions or locking to prevent race conditions from multiple requests.
** Require authentication on all redemption endpoints.
** Add rate limiting or throttling to discourage abuse.

# 3. Log All Reward Transactions and Badge Assignments
** Maintain an append-only log of all reward redemptions and badge assignments.
** Include key unique details: user ID, reward ID, action, status, and timestamp.
** Make logs tamper-evident (e.g., hashing or write to an external logging service).
** Store logs separate from the main database and ensure logs are read-only for users.

# Key Suggestions for the Backend Team
** Design the database with clear relationships (users, rewards, redemptions, logs).
** Enforce validation at both the application and database level.
** Keep error messages simple, consistent, and secure.
** Store logs in a way that prevents silent edits or deletions.
** Support penetration testing by providing safe test accounts or sandbox data

# --Backend Team Action Items:

** Review and implement the above controls.
** Document test results.
** Report any gaps or risks to the security team.
