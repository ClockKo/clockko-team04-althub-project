# Profile and Settings Security Reference  

**Sprint Focus:** Profile updates, privacy settings, and user data protection  
**Audience:** Backend Development Team  

---

## 1. Purpose  
This guideline ensures the secure handling of user profile and settings data in line with cybersecurity principles and NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) 2023. The action points for the backend team are outlined below.  

---

## 2. Access Control  
- Enforce role-based access: only logged-in users can update their own profiles (verify userID against token).  
- A user must never be able to update another user’s profile (ID-based checks).  
- Require JWT or OAuth 2.1 authentication tokens on all profile-related API calls.  
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on profile endpoints.  

---

## 3. Privacy Settings  
- Store privacy settings securely (encrypt if they reveal sensitive choices).  
- Always set privacy-friendly defaults (e.g., “minimal sharing” instead of “public by default”).  
- Reject invalid or malformed privacy settings before saving.  
- NDPR Alignment: Users must always have the ability to control how their personal data is shared.  

---

## 4. Data Exposure Prevention  
- API responses should return only safe fields (e.g., username, avatar, bio).  
- Never expose passwords, tokens, or internal IDs in responses.  
- Sanitize and validate all user input before saving to the database.  
- Apply field-level filters so sensitive fields (like reflections or email) never leak.  
- NDPR Alignment: Avoid unnecessary disclosure of personal data (principle of data minimization).  

---

## 5. Logging & Monitoring  
- Log all profile update attempts (with userID and timestamp).  
- Do not log sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, tokens, reflections).  
- Flag repeated failed update attempts for security team review.  
- NDPR Alignment: Logs must not store personal data unnecessarily.  

---

## 6. Secure Update Process  
- Use parameterized queries or ORM protections to prevent SQL injection.  
- Validate all input (e.g., usernames must be alphanumeric, max length enforced).  
- Apply CSRF protection for requests coming from web clients.

## 7. Backend Action Checklist (Quick Reference)  
- [ ] Only the owner can update their profile.  
- [ ] Privacy settings default to “most secure.”  
- [ ] API responses exclude sensitive fields.  
- [ ] Logs track activity but exclude private data.  
- [ ] All input is validated and sanitized.  
- [ ] SQL injection and CSRF protections in place.  
- [ ] Brute-force attempts are limited and flagged.
