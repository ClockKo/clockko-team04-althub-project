Security Objectives

Protect sensitive user data such as credentials and personal reflections.
Ensure integrity and availability of time logs, tasks, and analytics.
Align with NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) for privacy and data handling.

Data classified by Sensitivity
user_credentials: "High",
reflections: "High",
time_logs: "Medium",
tasks: "Medium",
leaderboard: "Low"

Define User Roles and Access Boundaries
Establish Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all endpoints:

const roles = {user: ['read_own_data', 'update_profile'],
admin: ['manage_users', 'view_analytics'],
system: ['aggregate_data', 'run_jobs']

Enforce role checks in backend logic:

function authorize(role, action) {
return roles[role]?.includes(action);}
4. Establish Core Security Controls
Authentication

Use JWT for session management.
Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.

if (user.role === 'admin' && !user.mfaVerified) {
throw new Error('MFA required');}

Authorization

Apply RBAC middleware to protect sensitive routes:

app.use('/admin', checkRole('admin'));

Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256.
Enforce TLS 1.3 for all data in transit.

Logging and Monitoring

Log critical actions such as logins and data changes:

logger.info(User ${user.id} updated profile at ${new Date()});

Monitor for suspicious behavior like mass deletions or failed login attempts.

NDPR Compliance Setup
Add consent tracking to user profiles:
user = {
...,
consentGiven: true,
reflectionRetentionDays: 30}

5b) Schedule secure deletion of reflections after retention period:

cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', deleteExpiredReflections);

Minimize data exposure in API responses:

delete user.password;
delete user.mfaSecret;

Backend Authentication Implementation Checklist

To protect user accounts and sensitive data within Clocko, a robust and hardened authentication framework is necessary. This section details the core policies and technical standards for managing user credentials, enforcing secure access, and mitigating common threats. The end goal is to ensure that authentication mechanisms are concrete, user-friendly, and aligned with industry best practices.

Password policies and management
Enforce minimum password length of 12 characters
Require complexity: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
Prevent reuse of last 3 passwords
Block passwords containing username or any credentials given
Hash passwords using:
[ ] bcrypt with â‰¥12 salt rounds
or
[ ] Argon2id with recommended parameters (memory: 64MB+, time: 3+, parallelism: 2)
[ ] Generate and store unique salt per password

Account Lockout Policies
Lock account after 4 failed login attempts
Lockout duration: 8 minutes
Notify admin after 4 failed attempts
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA to be required for all the following procedures;

1Admin accounts
Users with access to sensitive data
Privileged actions (e.g. password reset)
3rd party Payments or card use

Implement Time-based One-Time Password using either speakeasy (Node.js) or pyotp (Python)
Support Authentication code generation for MFA setup
Allow SMS/email OTP as backup (optional)

Session Management
Expire sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity
Use secure cookies with flags:
[ ] HttpOnly
[ ] Secure
[ ] SameSite=Strict
Rotate refresh tokens securely
Transport & Logging
Enforce HTTPS on all auth endpoints
Log all authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts, MFA challenges)
