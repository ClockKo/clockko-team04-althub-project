## üå± Seeding Rooms for Production

### Manual Seed Script

Run this to create default rooms in any environment:

```bash
python seed_coworking_rooms.py
```

The script will:
- ‚úì Check if rooms already exist (won't duplicate)
- ‚úì Create 5 default rooms if none exist
- ‚úì Skip seeding if rooms are already present

### Automatic Seeding on Deployment

**Option 1: Add to deployment script**
```bash
# In your deployment workflow
python seed_coworking_rooms.py
```

**Option 2: Database migrations**
Consider adding room seeding to Alembic migrations for production deployments.

## üîê Security Considerations

### Admin Endpoints

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Admin endpoints currently have placeholder authorization.

**What's Needed:**
1. Add proper admin role checking
2. Implement admin middleware/decorator
3. Example implementation:

```python
from app.core.auth import require_admin  # To be implemented

@router.post("/admin/rooms")
def create_room(
    room_data: CoworkingRoomCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(require_admin)  # Add admin check
):
    ...
```

**Recommended Approach:**
- Create `is_admin` field in User model
- Or use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Or create separate admin authentication
