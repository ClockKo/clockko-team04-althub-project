# 🔧 Time Tracker Navigation Issue - Troubleshooting

## 🐛 **Issue**: Summary clears when navigating away and back

### 📊 **What to Check:**

1. **Open DevTools Console** 
2. **Start a focus session and stop it**
3. **Navigate to another feature** (Tasks, Dashboard, etc.)
4. **Navigate back to Time Tracker**
5. **Watch the console logs**

### 🔍 **Key Console Messages to Look For:**

#### **When Leaving Time Tracker:**
```
⚠️ TimeTrackerPanel unmounting...
📱 Session on unmount: {...}
📊 Summary on unmount: {...}
```

#### **When Returning to Time Tracker:**
```
🔄 TimeTrackerPanel mounting, checking for sessions...
ℹ️ Active session found, but timer is not running in UI. User may have navigated away.
📊 Loaded daily summary on mount: {...}
```

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now:**
- ✅ Sessions should NOT be auto-cleared when navigating
- ✅ Only sessions running >3 hours get cleared as "stuck"
- ✅ Daily summary should persist across navigation
- ✅ Data should reload correctly when returning

### 🛠️ **Debug Steps:**

1. **Complete a focus session**
2. **Check localStorage state** (click "🔄 Refresh Summary" button)
3. **Navigate away and back**
4. **Check if data is still there**

### 🔧 **Manual Checks:**

**In Console, run:**
```javascript
// Check what's actually stored
console.log('Current Session:', localStorage.getItem('timetracker_current_session'));
console.log('Daily Summary:', localStorage.getItem('timetracker_daily_summary'));

// Parse and inspect
const summary = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('timetracker_daily_summary'));
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
console.log('Today Summary:', summary[today]);
```

### 🎮 **Test Scenario:**

1. **Start 1-minute timer**
2. **Let it complete naturally**
3. **Verify summary updates** (should show 1 session, 60 seconds)
4. **Navigate to Tasks feature**
5. **Navigate back to Time Tracker**
6. **Check if summary still shows 1 session, 60 seconds**

If the summary disappears, we'll see exactly what's happening in the console logs! 🕵️‍♂️
