# 📌 Notes

- Backend team should begin API design ahead of each frontend sprint; sync regularly with frontend for contract alignment.
- Cloud Engineering is involved at each stage for CI/CD, infra, and deployment support.
- Cybersecurity reviews and tests should be done early (shift-left) and at each sprint’s completion.
- Each sprint should include code review, documentation, and a demo, with all teams participating as relevant.
